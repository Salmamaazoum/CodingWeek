# Dataviz CW-2 Group 5

Second Week of the Coding Weeks in CentraleSupélec.

## Description

Our objective is to analyze data on crimes and sentiments expressed on Twitter in defferent departements in france. We aim to assess the consistency between public perceptions on Twitter and the actual occurrences of crimes.

## How does it work ?

To initiate the program, execute the main.py script. Subsequently, it will provide a link for accessing two maps of France, one depicting the number of crimes and the other representing the number of gendarmerie per year for each location. Additionally, an histogram illustrating the evolution of the number of crimes for a selected department will be displayed. For further charts, use the command main.py -h to view available options.
